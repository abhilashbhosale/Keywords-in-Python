Keyword	
False - 	Boolean value representing falsehood.
None - 	Represents the absence of a value or null.
True - 	Boolean value representing truth.
and - 	Logical AND operator. Combines conditional statements.
as - 	Used to create an alias, commonly used in with statements or imports.
assert - 	Used for debugging; raises an AssertionError if the condition is not met.
async - 	Used to define asynchronous functions or indicate asynchronous context.
await - 	Used to pause execution until an awaited coroutine completes.
break - 	Exits the nearest enclosing loop prematurely.
class - 	Used to define a class.
continue - 	Skips the rest of the current loop iteration and proceeds to the next.
def	 - Used to define a function.
del - 	Deletes a reference to an object.
elif - 	Conditional statement (else-if).
else -  - 	Conditional statement for alternative code execution.
except - 	Defines a block of code to handle exceptions.

raise	 - Raises an exception.
return - 	Exits a function and optionally returns a value.

while - 	Defines a loop that continues as long as a condition is true.
